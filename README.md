# Ð¡ache compression
Investigation of cache compression using the base-delta-immediate algorithm. The project consists of a system of modules on systemverilog, implementing a system consisting of cache memory, cache controller and main memory. This is tested with a simple cocotb test and run in modelsim

# Cache
The cache has the following characteristics:
* 32 KiB 
* 8-way set associative
* 1024 lines
* 32B line size
* Write-through policy
* On-demand fill
* LFU replacing

# Compressor
The compressor selects two cache lines at adjacent addresses and performs compression. If compression is successful, the cache line stores two compressed cache lines
